# Golden Eagle Flight Plan (GEFP)

Golden Eagle Flight Plan (GEFP) is a web-based developmental advising tool
designed to promote a more holistic view of students' education and better
encourage students to develop their own professional identity.

GEFP enables students and advisors to keep track of the students' educational
goals, or milestones, and progress toward reaching those milestones. Each
milestone is classified both by the level at which advisors
believe students should aim to complete and by the dimension of the student's
college education under which that milestone falls. Thus the flight plan forms
a matrix divided into stages of their career (i.e., from pre-frosh through
senior level) and into *runways*, which we categorized as 1) academic
performance; 2) career preparation; and 3) leadership & community engagement.
Advisors for each degree program collaborate to identify the milestones most
appropriate for students in that major throughout the various stages of the
program.

GEFP was designed by Dr. Emily Allen and Dr. Deborah S. Won as part of the
[FYrE@ECST](http://www.calstatela.edu/ecst/fyre) program in the College of
Engineering, Computer Science, and Technology at California State University,
Los Angeles. It was implemented by Harsh Gadhia as his
[MS thesis project](https://csns.calstatela.edu/download?fileId=5367971) under
the supervision of Dr. Chengyu Sun.
